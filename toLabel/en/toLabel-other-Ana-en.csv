This is the only reason that it is said that all renewable energy sources are sustainable but all sustainable energy sources are not renewable.	No emotion
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The US should led the global supply chain and should get the World ready and be prepared for the worst case. Since the borders are closed, unmanaged and non-optimized global food trade might eventually affect the food supplies.	Fear
